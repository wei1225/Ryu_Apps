*****the priority of the flow entry***** 
Packets are matched against flow entries based on prioritization. An entry that
specifies an exact match (i.e., it has no wildcards) is always the highest priority.
All wildcard entries have a priority associated with them. Higher priority entries
must match before lower priority ones. If multiple entries have the same priority,
the switch is free to choose any ordering. Higher numbers have higher priorities.

example:

*****add a flow entry*****:
ipv4:#actions is a list of dicts
{'dpid':1,'actions':[{'type':'OUTPUT','port':4}],'rule':{'in_port':1,'dl_type':0x0800,'dl_src':'5c:ac:4c:08:d8:af','nw_src':'10.0.0.1','nw_src_masked':24}}
ipv6:
{'dpid':1,'actions':[{'type':'OUTPUT','port':4}],'rule':{'in_port':1,'dl_type':0x86dd,'dl_src':'5c:ac:4c:08:d8:af','ipv6_src':'10::1','ipv6_src_masked':64}}

*****modify a flow entry*****:
you can only modify the 'actions' item in a flow entry,if you want to change anything else,it equal to add a new flow entry.No matter modify or delete flow entries,they are all matched according to the 'rule' item.when the 'actions' item doesn't exist or is a empty list,it means we do nothing to the packets matched the flow entry,so these packet are droped.

change before:
{'dpid':1,'actions':[{'type':'OUTPUT','port':4}],'rule':{'dl_type':0x0800,'nw_src':'10.0.0.1','nw_src_masked':24}}
change after:--output port is changed from 4 to 100
{'dpid':1,'actions':[{'type':'OUTPUT','port':100}],'rule':{'dl_type':0x0800,'nw_src':'10.0.0.1','nw_src_masked':24}}
 
*****delete a flow entry*****
liking modify,more detail the 'rule' item are,the less entries are deleted,if the 'rule' is null, all flow entries are moved.  
{'dpid':1}-- the 'rule' is empty.
